        The dog is a pet animal and is considered to be one of the most obedient animals. 
        There are various kinds of dogs in the world, and some of them are known to be very friendly while some are dangerous. 
        There are various species of dogs that we come across, and some have slippery shiny skin, while others have rough skin.
         Dogs are carnivorous animals and they like eating meat. Dogs have four legs, two ears, and a tail.

         Dogs, like humans, are highly social animals and this similarity in their overall behavioural pattern accounts for their trainability, playfulnes and ability to fit into human households and social situations. 
         This similarity has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships.

     The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts as pack animals closely mimics the human idea of love and friendship, leading many dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family members.
